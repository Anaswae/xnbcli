# xnbcli
A CLI tool for XNB packing/unpacking purpose built for Stardew Valley.

This tool currently supports unpacking all LZX compressed XNB files for Stardew Valley.  
There is some basic groundwork for XACT as well.

The end goal for this project is to serve as a CLI for a GUI wrapper to leverage so the average user can interface with
XNB files a lot easier.
